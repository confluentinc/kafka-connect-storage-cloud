[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fconfluentinc%2Fkafka-connect-storage-cloud.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fconfluentinc%2Fkafka-connect-storage-cloud?ref=badge_shield)


*kafka-connect-storage-cloud* is the repository for Confluent's [Kafka Connectors](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect)
designed to be used to copy data from Kafka into Amazon S3. 

## Kafka Connect Sink Connector for Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)

Documentation for this connector can be found [here](http://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/connect-storage-cloud/kafka-connect-s3/docs/index.html).

Blogpost for this connector can be found [here](https://www.confluent.io/blog/apache-kafka-to-amazon-s3-exactly-once).

# Development

To build a development version you'll need a recent version of Kafka 
as well as a set of upstream Confluent projects, which you'll have to build from their appropriate snapshot branch.
See [the kafka-connect-storage-common FAQ](https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-connect-storage-common/wiki/FAQ)
for guidance on this process.

You can build *kafka-connect-storage-cloud* with Maven using the standard lifecycle phases.

# Integration Tests

## Test Setup

The following resources need to be setup to run integration tests with a real S3 instance. 

### AWS Credentials

The integration tests follow the `DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain` for S3 authentication. 
One of the simplest ways to test locally is to configure the `.aws/credentials` file. 
You can also define environment variable as described [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html)

To test on Jenkins, create a json format credential file and define `AWS_CREDENTIALS_PATH` to point it.
e.g. the following script will create the json file using the environment variable values.

```
cat << EOF > s3_credentials.json
{
"aws_access_key_id": "$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID",
"aws_secret_access_key": "$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
}
EOF
```

## Running the Tests
Tests can be run manually using the `mvn integration-test` command 
or through IntelliJ by running the class.
