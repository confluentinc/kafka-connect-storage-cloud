*kafka-connect-storage-cloud* is a suite of [Kafka Connectors](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect)
designed to be used to copy data between Kafka and public cloud stores, such as Amazon S3. The currently available connectors are listed below:

## Kafka Connect Sink Connector for Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)

Documentation for this connector can be found [here](http://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/connect-storage-cloud/kafka-connect-s3/docs/index.html).

# Development

To build a development version you'll need a recent version of Kafka 
as well as a set of upstream Confluent projects, which you'll have to build from their appropriate snapshot branch.
See [the kafka-connect-storage-common FAQ](https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-connect-storage-common/wiki/FAQ)
for guidance on this process.

You can build *kafka-connect-storage-cloud* with Maven using the standard lifecycle phases.
